## Geometric parameters

We consider a I-shaped constant cross-section for the beam with bottom and top flange widths `wb` and `wt` and of height `h`. The arch will be a portion of a circular arc of total angle opening $2\theta$ and chord length $L$. The circular arc radius is therefore given by $R=\dfrac{L}{2\sin(\theta)}$ and the arch rise by $f=R-\dfrac{L}{2\tan(\theta)}$.

```{code-cell}
import gmsh
import numpy as np

filename = "I_beam"
# I-beam profile
wb = 0.2  # bottom flange width
wt = 0.3  # top flange width
h = 0.5  # web height
# Arch geometry
theta = np.pi / 6  # arch opening half-angle
L = 10.0  # chord length
R = L / 2 / np.sin(theta)  # arch radius
f = R - L / 2 / np.tan(theta)  # arch rise
```

## Defining points and lines for the left-hand side cross-section

We first begin by initializing Gmsh ang use the built-in `geo` CAD kernel since we won't require any boolean operation which require the use of the Open Cascade kernel.

```{code-cell}
gmsh.initialize()
geom = gmsh.model.geo
```

Next, we define the points and lines of the left-hand side cross-section. To facilitate their definition, these objects are first defined for a vertical cross-section located in the $X=0$ plane and centered on the origin $(0,0,0)$. We split them into a group of `bottom_points` for the `bottom_flange` and a group of `top_points` for the `top_flange`. The `web` then connects the middle points of each group. The `start_section` contains the web, bottom and top flange lines.

```{note}

Note that Gmsh requires passing a mesh density for each point definition. However, this `lcar` value will not be used in the end since we will later define the number of points on each line using the `TransfiniteCurve` command.
```

```{code-cell}
lcar = 0.1  # characteristic mesh size density (will not be used)
bottom_points = [
    geom.addPoint(0, -wb / 2, -h / 2, lcar),
    geom.addPoint(0, 0, -h / 2, lcar),
    geom.addPoint(0, wb / 2, -h / 2, lcar),
]
top_points = [
    geom.addPoint(0, -wt / 2, h / 2, lcar),
    geom.addPoint(0, 0, h / 2, lcar),
    geom.addPoint(0, wt / 2, h / 2, lcar),
]
bottom_flange = [
    geom.addLine(bottom_points[0], bottom_points[1]),
    geom.addLine(bottom_points[1], bottom_points[2]),
]
web = [geom.addLine(bottom_points[1], top_points[1])]
top_flange = [
    geom.addLine(top_points[0], top_points[1]),
    geom.addLine(top_points[1], top_points[2]),
]
start_section = bottom_flange + web + top_flange
```

## Cross-section rotation and extrusion

Now, we rotate this section by an angle equal to $-\theta$ around the $Y$ axis to obtain our initial starting section for the arch. The `rotate` command requires a `dimTags` first argument i.e. a list of tuple of the form `(dim, label)` where `dim` is the entity dimension (`dim=1` here for lines) and `label` is the label entity. The following arguments are then `x, y, z, ax, ay, az, angle` defining a rotation of angle `angle` around an axis of revolution passing through a point (`x`, `y`, `z`) along a direction (`ax`, `ay`, `az`).

```{code-cell}
dimTags = [(1, l) for l in start_section]
geom.rotate(dimTags, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, -theta)
```

We will now extrude the previously defined cross-section along a circular arc. The `extrude` command is used for extruding along a line, here we will need the Ì€`revolve` command to extrude the cross-section by following a rotation  of angle $2\theta$ which is defined similarly to the `rotate` command. Here, the axis follows the direction $(0, 1, 0)$ and passes through the point $(L/2, 0, -(R-f))$. We also pass a list of layers and corresponding numbers of elements generated during extrusion. Here, we have only one layer (normalized height = 1.0) of 50 elements.

The `revolve` command returns a list of *dimTags* corresponding to the newly created entities. For instance, when extruding a line, this will create a surface and three new lines. The output stores these entities as follows:
$[\text{end line}, \text{ surface}, \text{ lateral line }1,\text{ lateral line }2]$. We loop on the various entities composing the starting cross-section and append the newly created end-lines and surfaces in corresponding lists. Note that we need to call `synchronize` to update the corresponding Gmsh model with the newly created entities.

```{code-cell}
end_bottom_flange = []
end_top_flange = []
end_web = []
surfaces = []
for ini, end in zip(
    [bottom_flange, web, top_flange], [end_bottom_flange, end_web, end_top_flange]
):
    for l in ini:
        outDimTags = geom.revolve(
            [(1, l)],
            L / 2,
            0,
            -(R - f),
            0,
            1,
            0,
            2 * theta,
            numElements=[50],
            heights=[1.0],
        )
        end.append(outDimTags[0][1])
        surfaces.append(outDimTags[1][1])
        geom.synchronize()
end_section = end_bottom_flange + end_web + end_top_flange
```

## Tagging and mesh generation

We finish by specifying the number of elements for the flange and web discretization using the `setTransfiniteCurve` command. We also affect the physical tag `1` for the left-hand side cross-section and `2` for the right-hand side cross section. We do not forget to also add physical tags to the surfaces otherwise they well later be ignored when generating the mesh.

```{code-cell}
for f in bottom_flange + top_flange + end_bottom_flange + end_top_flange:
    geom.mesh.setTransfiniteCurve(f, 6)
for w in web + end_web:
    geom.mesh.setTransfiniteCurve(w, 11)

gmsh.model.addPhysicalGroup(2, surfaces, 1)
gmsh.model.addPhysicalGroup(1, start_section, 1)
gmsh.model.addPhysicalGroup(1, end_section, 2)
```

We can now call the mesh `generate` function (up to dimension `dim=2` since we don't have any 3D solid element here). The generated mesh is then exported to a `.msh`. We finish by the `finalize` command since we are finished with the Gmsh API.

```{tip}
You can export the corresponding `geo` file by writing to a file with a `.geo_unrolled` extension.
```

```{code-cell}
gmsh.model.mesh.generate(dim=2)
gmsh.write(filename + ".msh")

gmsh.finalize()
```
