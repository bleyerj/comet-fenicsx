    "\n",
    "There exist many methods to solve such a constrained optimization problem. It is important to note that constraints are here very simple as they bound only the minimum and maximum values of the optimization variable $x$. In particular, this setting does not allow for more general linear or non-linear equality or inequality constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "PETSc's [Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (TAO)](https://petsc.org/main/manual/tao/#) offers a wide range of algorithms to solve various constrained or unconstrained optimization problems, including bound-constrained problems. To interact with such a solver, the user is required to provide the objective function and the bounds. Depending on the chosen algorithm, the user should also provide:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Problem position\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a simple 1D bound constrained problem which arise from the use of *phase-field* or *damage gradient* models of brittle fracture {cite:p}`bourdin2000numerical,pham2011gradient`. In such methods, we simulate the propagation of cracks by minimizing a total energy consisting of an elastic and a fracture energy. When using one of the classical models of the phase-field approach, namely the $\\text{AT1}$ model, the fracture energy is written as:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: AT1-Efra\n",
    "\n",
    "\\mathcal{E}_\\text{f}(d) = \\dfrac{3G_\\text{c}}{8\\ell_0}\\int_{\\Omega}\\left(d + \\ell_0^2\\nabla d \\cdot\\nabla d\\right)\\dOm\n",
    "```\n",
    "where $d$ is a damage-like variable (with values in $[0;1]$) which smears the discrete crack representation (corresponding to $d=1$) over a regularization length $\\ell_0$. $G_\\text{c}$ represents the material fracture energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the solution process, the damage field is found by minimizing the total energy for a fixed displacement field and subject to bound constraints $d_n \\leq d \\leq 1$ where $d_n$ denotes the damage field at the previous time step which is used to enforce the irreversible evolution of damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "When subject to a given mechanical loading, damage field will tend to localize spatially, corresponding to a smeared crack representation. In the 1D setting, it is possible to characterize the shape of the localized solution by finding damage fields which minimize the fracture energy {eq}`AT1-Efra`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Localized 1D solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, we consider a 1D domain $\\Omega=[-L;L]$ of length $2L$ and we look for a minimizer $d(x)$ of:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: AT1-Efra-1D\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rl} \\displaystyle\\min_{d(x)} & \\displaystyle\\int_{\\Omega}\\left(d + \\ell_0^2\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial d}{\\partial x}\\right)^2\\right)\\dOm \\\\\n",
    "\\text{s.t.} & 0 \\leq d(x) \\leq 1 \\quad \\forall x \\in \\Omega\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where we ignored the factor $3G_\\text{c}/(8\\ell_0)$ of the fracture energy. In the following, we note $j(d)$ the objective function of {eq}`AT1-Efra-1D`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, in order to force localization around a given point, we will impose here the boundary condition $d(x)=d_0$ at $x=0$ where $d_0\\in [0;1]$ is given. In this case, we can show that there exists a region $]-D;D[$ where $0 < d(x) < 1$ and with $d(x)=0$ outside. We can show in particular that we must have $d(\\pm D) = \\dfrac{\\partial d}{\\partial x}(\\pm D) = 0$ at the transition points {cite:p}`pham2011gradient,pham2013onset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the inner region, since the bounds are not attained, the optimal solution is characterized by the fact that the first variation of the objective is null, that is:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "D_d j(d;\\widehat{d}) = 0 \\quad \\forall \\widehat{d}\\\\\n",
    "\\int_{\\Omega} \\left(\\widehat{d} + \\ell_0^2 \\dfrac{\\partial d}{\\partial x}\\dfrac{\\partial \\widehat{d}}{\\partial x}\\right)\\dOm = 0 \\quad \\forall \\widehat{d}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding linear variational problem results in the following strong form differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dfrac{\\partial^2 d}{\\partial x^2} = \\dfrac{1}{2\\ell_0^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Accounting for the following boundary conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "d(0)=d_0 \\quad ; \\quad d(\\pm D) = 0 \\quad ;\\quad  \\dfrac{\\partial d}{\\partial x}(\\pm D) = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we easily show that the localization region size is $D=2\\ell_0\\sqrt{d_0}$ and that the solution is given by:\n",

    ":label: AT1-1D-solution\n",
