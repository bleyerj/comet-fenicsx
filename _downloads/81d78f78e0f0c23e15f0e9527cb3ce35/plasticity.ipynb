It will ensure an optimal convergence rate for the Newton-Raphson method, see chap. 26 of {cite:p}`logg2012fenicsbook`. We will need `Quadrature` elements for 4-dimensional vectors and scalars, the number of Gauss points will be determined by the required degree `deg_quad` of the `Quadrature` element, see the [](/tips/quadrature_schemes/quadrature_schemes.md) tour for more details on the choice of quadrature rules.\n",

    "We discretize the applied loading using `Nincr` increments from $0$ up to a value slightly larger than $1$ (we exclude $0$ from the list of load steps). A nonlinear discretization is adopted to refine the load steps during the plastic evolution phase. At each time increment, the system is assembled and the residual norm is computed. The incremental displacement `Du` is initialized to zero and the inner iteration loop performing the constitutive update is initiated. Inside this loop, corrections `du` to the displacement increment `Du` are computed by solving the Newton system and the return mapping update is performed using the current total strain increment `deps`. The resulting quantities are then interpolated onto their appropriate `Quadrature` function space. The Newton system and residuals are reassembled and this procedure continues until the residual norm falls below a given tolerance. After convergence of the iteration loop, the total displacement, stress and plastic strain states are updated for the next time step."
