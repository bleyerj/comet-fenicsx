    "## Handling finite rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing a parametrization\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling finite rotations is a difficult point in a finite-element context as these should be described through rotation matrices $\\bR$ belonging to the special orthogonal group $SO(3)$ i.e. such that $\\bR\\T\\bR=\\bI$ and $\\det\\bR=1$. It is however not possible to easily interpolate elements of this group using standard finite-element techniques. Various approaches therefore attempt to parametrize elements of this group such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* vectorial parametrizations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Euler-angle parametrizations\n",
    "\n",
    "* quaternion parametrizations\n",
    "\n",
    "* cosine direction parametrizations...\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these methods, a rotation matrix is parametrized by a finite set of parameters: e.g. 3 for vectorial and Euler angle parametrizations, 4 for quaternion parametrizations, 9 for cosine direction, etc. Each of these methods will have some sort of singularity in the parametrization as the mapping can never be bijective. As a result, all methods possess some advantages and some drawbacks, either on the theoretical or computational point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tour, we make use of vectorial parametrizations which have the advantage of being based on a parameter, namely the rotation vector $\\btheta$, which behaves as a Cartesian 3D vector. We refer to {cite:p}`bauchau2003vectorial` for an excellent and unified presentation of the vectorial parametrization. Implementation is described in the following document [](rotation_parametrization_description.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A reminder on rotation matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "A rotation can be described by a unit rotation axis $\\bu$ and a rotation angle $\\varphi$, thus defining a rotation vector $\\btheta=\\varphi\\bu$. The link with the rotation matrix $\\bR$ is given by the well-known Euler-Rodrigues formula:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\bR = \\bI + \\dfrac{\\sin\\varphi}{\\varphi}\\bP + \\left(\\dfrac{\\sin(\\varphi/2)}{\\varphi/2}\\right)^2\\bP^2\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "with $\\bP = \\skew(\\btheta)$ where $\\skew$ defines the skew-symmetric matrix associated with the cross-product operation of a vector, that is:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\skew(\\ba)\\bb &= \\ba \\times \\bb \\quad \\forall \\bb \\\\\n",
    "\\skew(\\ba) &= \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -a_3 & a_2\\\\ a_3 & 0 & -a_1 \\\\ -a_2 & a_1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "We also introduce $\\axial(\\bA)=\\ba$ the inverse operation associated to a skew-symmetric matrix $\\bA$ the corresponding vector $\\ba$ such that $\\bA=\\skew(\\ba)$. We also have that $\\axial(\\bR\\bA\\bR\\T)=\\bR\\ba$ when $\\bR$ is a rotation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any rotation matrix $\\bR$, we have $\\dot{\\overline{\\bR\\T\\bR}} = \\dot\\bR\\T\\bR +  \\bR\\T\\dot\\bR=0$ from which we deduce that $\\bTheta=\\bR\\T\\dot\\bR$ is skew-symmetric. We denote by $\\bvartheta = \\axial(\\Theta)$ the so-called spatial spin vector associated with the rotation matrix. The link between the spin vector and the time derivative of the rotation vector is given by the rotation curvature matrix $\\bH$:\n",

    "\n",
    "### The small rotation case\n",
    "\n",
    "For small rotations i.e. $\\|\\btheta\\|=\\varphi \\ll 1$, we have $\\bR \\approx \\bI + \\bP$. As a result:\n",

    "\n",
    "Following the notations from {cite:p}`magisano2020large`, we consider a nonlinear Timoshenko beam model which is described by the position  $\\br_0(s)$ of the beam axis in the reference undeformed configuration $\\mathcal{L}_0$ where $s$ is the beam curvilinear coordinate. The reference configuration $\\mathcal{L}_0$ is also described by a triad of unit material vectors $\\bG_i(s)$ representing the beam axis $\\bG_1$ and the cross-section principal axis $\\bG_2,\\bG_3$. Note that $\\bG_1$ is equal to the unit tangent vector:\n",

    "where $S$ is the beam cross-section, $E,\\mu$ the Young and shear moduli, $S_2^*,S_3^*$ the reduced cross-sections accounting for shear reduction coefficients (see [this tour](https://comet-fenics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demo/cross_section_analysis/cross_section_analysis.html)), $J$ the torsional inertia and $I_2,I_3$ the area moment of inertia.\n",

    "## Incremental formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, any rotation parametrization will encounter singularity issues for large rotation angles (e.g. $\\pi$ or $2\\pi$ depending on the chosen parametrization). The previous formulation will therefore be unable to solve problems in which the solution experiences rotation angles of such amplitudes. As an alternative, it is possible to solve only, for a given load step, for the incremental displacement and rotation with respect to the known equilibrium from the previous converged load step. Positions and material triad orientations must therefore be updated at the end of every load step. With such an approach, singularity issues will only encountered if the incremental rotation is too large, which is not a strong requirement in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this `incremental` approach, let us consider that $\\bu$ and $\\btheta$ now represent the displacement and rotation vector increments with respect to a known configuration at load step $n$. The sought configuration at load step $n+1$ is obtained from:\n",

    "\\br_{n+1} &= \\br_n+\\bu \\\\\n",
    "\\bR_{n+1} &= \\bR(\\btheta)\\bR_n\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the strain measures, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\bepsilon_{n+1} &=\\bR_n\\T\\bR(\\btheta)\\T(\\bu_{,s}+\\br_{n,s}) - \\br_{n,s} \\\\\n",
    "\\bchi_{n+1} &= \\axial( \\bR_n\\T\\bR(\\btheta)\\T(\\bR(\\btheta)\\bR_n)_{,s}) \\\\\n",
    "&= \\axial( \\bR_n\\T\\bR_{n,s}) + \\axial(\\bR_n\\T\\bTheta_{,s}\\bR_n) \\\\\n",
    "&= \\bchi_n + \\bR_n\\T\\axial(\\bTheta_{,s}) \\\\\n",
    "&= \\bchi_n + \\bR_n\\T\\bH\\T\\btheta_{,s}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following implementation, we will store the curvature strain and the rotation matrix of the previous time step as functions defined on a suitable function space (DG-0 for instance). As discussed in {cite:p}`magisano2020large` such kind of choice results in a path-dependent solution due to the non-linear nature of the group of rotations. Several strategies can be considered to alleviate or suppress such lack of objectivity. In the following, we chose to ignore this issue, the effects of which diminish upon load step and mesh refinement.\n",
