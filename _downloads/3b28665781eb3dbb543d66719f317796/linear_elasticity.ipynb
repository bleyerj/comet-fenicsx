    "## Variational formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving PDEs with FEniCSx requires to formulate the problem in *weak* or *variational* form. For a general introduction to variational formulations within the FEniCSx context, we refer the reader to https://jsdokken.com/dolfinx-tutorial/chapter1/fundamentals.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of solid mechanics, the variational formulation within a small strain setting reads as:\n",
    "> Find $\\bu \\in V$ such that:\n",
    "> \\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\int_\\Omega \\bsig(\\bu):\\nabla^\\text{s} \\bv \\dOm = \\int_\\Omega \\boldsymbol{f}\\cdot\\bv \\dOm + \\int_\\Neumann \\bT\\cdot\\bv \\dS \\quad \\forall \\bv \\in V_0\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bu$ is the unknown displacement (the *trial* function) living in the space of admissible displacements $V$ such that $\\bu=\\bu_0$ on the Dirichlet boundary $\\Dirichlet$. $\\boldsymbol{f}$ and $\\bT$ are respectively body and surface traction forces. $\\sigma(\\bu)$ is the Cauchy stress field which depends on the displacement $\\bu$. Finally, $\\bv$ denotes *test* functions living in the space of admissible perturbations $V_0$ i.e. such that $\\bv=0$ on $\\Dirichlet$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above variational formulation represents the weak form of equilibrium and must be supplemented by a constitutive relation. In the linear elastic case, we have $\\bsig(\\bu) = \\mathbb{C}:\\nabla^s \\bu$ so that the above variational formulation reads:\n",
    "> Find $\\bu \\in V$ such that:\n",
    "> \\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\int_\\Omega \\nabla^\\text{s}\\bu:\\mathbb{C}:\\nabla^\\text{s} \\bv \\dOm = \\int_\\Omega \\boldsymbol{f}\\cdot\\bv \\dOm + \\int_\\Neumann \\bT\\cdot\\bv \\dS \\quad \\forall \\bv \\in V_0\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The left-hand side is a *bilinear form* of $\\bu$ and $\\bv$ whereas the right-hand side is a *linear form*. The above equality is generally written as $a(\\bu,\\bv) = L(\\bv)\\quad \\forall \\bv \\in V_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of FEniCS is precisely to easily define such forms using symbolic expressions. After choosing a finite-element approximation for the test and trial function spaces, it will automatically generate code to compute the corresponding global stiffness matrix (for $a$) and vector of nodal forces (for $L$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant packages\n",
    "\n",
    "* **UFL**: Symbolic expressions involved in the above expressions are handled by the `ufl` ([Unified Form Language](https://github.com/FEniCS/ufl)] package which allows to combine abstract operators in a notation close to the mathematical one. UFL also provide the `TestFunction` and `TrialFunction` objects appearing as arguments of linear or bilinear forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **DOLFINx**: The `dolfinx` package is the Python interface to the computational environment of FEniCSx. It provides all the necessary tools to load meshes, handle data structures and functions related to finite-elements (global FE function spaces and associated functions, assembling procedures, boundary conditions, solvers, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "* other packages may include `mpi4py` for MPI parallel communication, `petsc4py` for interaction with PETSc objects, `ffcx` for Just-In-Time compilation of forms, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We will model a 2D rectangular beam of dimensions $10\\times 1$ which we will mesh with quadrangles. We first start by loading the relevant packages and functions. The `dolfinx.mesh` module provides a customary function for meshing a rectangular domain. For more complex cases, we can import meshes generated by external tools such as GMSH for instance."
