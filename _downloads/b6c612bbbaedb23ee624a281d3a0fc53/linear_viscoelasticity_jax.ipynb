    "#### Tangent operator with Automatic Differentiation\n",
    "The constitutive equation should also return the algorithmic tangent operator $\\mathbf{C}_\\text{tang} = \\dfrac{\\text{d} \\bsig}{\\text{d}\\beps}$. Although the latter is extremely easy to compute in the present case, we show how to use JAX's Automatic Differentiation capabilities to derive it automatically. We rely on the `jax.jacfwd` function which computes the jacobian of the `local_constitutive_update` function with respect to argument `argnums=0`, namely $\\Delta \\beps$ here. The computation is done using forward-mode automatic differentiation, although here the tangent operator is of square shape so that there should be no significant difference with backward-mode. Finally, `local_constitutive_update` also returns `state` as an auxiliary output. This is specified explicitly with `has_aux=True` which indicates that the function returns a pair where the first element is considered the output of the mathematical function to be differentiated and the second element is auxiliary data. In this case, the output of `jacfwd` is `(jacobian, state)`."

    "#### JIT and automatic vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will later have to call this function when looping over all quadrature points. Implementing such a loop in pure Python would obviously be extremely inefficient. An alternative would be to rewrite the `local_constitutive_update` function in vectorized form to work on a batch of strain-like quantities of shape `(3,num_gauss)` where `num_gauss` is the total number of Gauss points. Although this is not particularly difficult to implement in the present case, it requires reimplementing the function which is error-prone and cumbersome in general. Fortunately, JAX provides a way to automatically transform a function into an efficient vectorized form using `jax.vmap`. Applying this vectorization to the `tangent_operator_and_state` function, we simply specify that the batch will take place over axis 0 of the first 3 arguments but not the last one (`dt` is not batched). Finally, the resulting function is also jitted for efficient compilation and execution by the XLA compiler."
