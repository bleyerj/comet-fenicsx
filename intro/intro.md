# Introduction

This section contains a set of short numerical tours to get introduced to `FEniCSx`, covering a simple linear elasticity problem, a non-linear elasticity problem and a multi-field plate problem.

For another general introduction to `FEniCSx`, we heavily recommand to follow the "official" [FEniCSx tutorial](https://jsdokken.com/dolfinx-tutorial/index.html) by JÃ¸rgen S. Dokken.
