# Welcome to these Numerical Tours of Computational Mechanics with FEniCS.

## What is it about ?

These numerical tours will introduce you to a wide variety of topics in computational continuum and structural mechanics using the finite element software FEniCSx. Many covered topics can be considered as standard and will help the reader in getting started with FEniCS using solid mechanics examples.

Other topics will also be more exploratory and will reflect currently investigated research topics, illustrating the versatility of FEniCS.

This book is organized in the following different parts:
* [Introduction](intro) is a set of short numerical tours to get introduced to FEniCSx, covering a simple linear elasticity problem, a non-linear elasticity problem and a multi-field plate problem
* [Tours](tours) is the main body of this book and contains a many numerical tours covering a large range of various topics of interest in computational mechanics
* [Tips & Tricks](tips) contains different code snippets which can be useful in various occasions
