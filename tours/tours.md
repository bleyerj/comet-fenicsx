# Tours

These numerical tours are designed to introduce you to various aspects of computational solid and structural mechanics, utilizing the finite element software FEniCSx. They are intended to complement the existing FEniCSx tutorials in the official documentation by focusing on specific applications within the mechanics field.

While many of the covered topics are standard and relatively easy to implement, others, such as structural elements (beams, plates, and shells) or nonlinear constitutive models, present more complexity.
Other topics will also be more advanced ans exploratory and will reflect currently investigated research topics, illustrating the versatility of FEniCS for handling advanced models.

The purpose of these tours is to offer users with a background in mechanics a starting point for utilizing FEniCSx, using examples familiar to them.
