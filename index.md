# Welcome to these Numerical Tours of Computational Mechanics with FEniCSx

## What is it about ?

These numerical tours will introduce you to a wide variety of topics in computational continuum and structural mechanics using the finite element software `FEniCSx`, http://fenicsproject.org. Many covered topics can be considered as standard and will help the reader in getting started with FEniCS using solid mechanics examples.

Other topics will also be more exploratory and will reflect currently investigated research topics, illustrating the versatility of FEniCS.

This book is organized in the following different parts:

### Introduction
This part contains a set of short numerical tours to get introduced to `FEniCSx` via basic examples:
  - a [linear elasticity problem](intro/linear_elasticity.md)
  - a [non-linear elasticity problem](intro/hyperelasticity.md)
  - a [multi-field plate problem](intro/plates.md)

```{seealso}
For another general introduction to `FEniCSx`, we heavily recommend to follow the "official" [FEniCSx tutorial](https://jsdokken.com/dolfinx-tutorial/index.html) by JÃ¸rgen S. Dokken.
```

### Tours
This part is the main body of this book. These numerical tours are designed to introduce you to various aspects of computational solid and structural mechanics, utilizing the finite element software FEniCSx. They are intended to complement the existing FEniCSx tutorials in the official documentation by focusing on specific applications within the mechanics field.

While many of the covered topics are standard and relatively easy to implement, others, such as structural elements (beams, plates, and shells) or nonlinear constitutive models, present more complexity.
Other topics will also be more advanced ans exploratory and will reflect currently investigated research topics, illustrating the versatility of FEniCS for handling advanced models.

The purpose of these tours is to offer users with a background in mechanics a starting point for utilizing FEniCSx, using examples familiar to them.
